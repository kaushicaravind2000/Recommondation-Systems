## Recommendation Systems
Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering recommends items based on the similarity between users or items. This section includes implementations of:

User-based collaborative filtering
Item-based collaborative filtering
Content-Based Filtering
Content-based filtering recommends items based on the similarity between the content of items and a user's past preferences. This section includes:

Feature extraction and similarity calculation
Item recommendation based on content similarity
Matrix Factorization
Matrix factorization techniques decompose the user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional matrices. This section includes:

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Alternating Least Squares (ALS)
Hybrid Methods
Hybrid methods combine collaborative and content-based filtering to leverage the strengths of both approaches. This section includes:

A hybrid recommendation system that combines user and item features with collaborative filtering.
